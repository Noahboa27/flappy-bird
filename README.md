# flappy-bird

While studying python in my free time I came across an interesting module called pygame.  Eager to try it out, I thought back to the simple game of Flappy Bird.  There's not anything crazy complex happening in the game, and I already knew how it was supposed to look.  With this is mind I began learning how pygame worked.  This was a great learning experenice for me while being fun at the same time.  I learned alot about how games really worked behind the scenes, despite it being so simple, and that was exciting.  On top of that I got to hone my python skills even further.  Give it a try and see if you can beat my high score of 10! :satisfied:
